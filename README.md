Education, household income and unemployment, how do they relate to each other? How do they differ in different regions? What has changed in the last three decades? We have chosen this group of datasets because we believe that there is an important correlation between the three that needs understanding. We have chosen the US not only for the easier access to a very clean and organized data but also because the US has one of the highest demographic variance, from crowded urban cities to vast and empty rural areas.
